# post cucumber 01

A quick demo using cucumber with rails.

## setup
See the gemfile for the stuff you need to install to get the thing to install correctly.
A readme is include in the gemfile so read that to see what command you need to run after you clone this repo.
Generally you need to run the bundle first.
You also want to run the installation scripts for various gems. Notes on what to run are in the gemfile.

You also probably want to run the migrations.
rake db:migrate
rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV='test'
